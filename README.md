# Practical Tips in Natural Language Processing Tasks

This is a (private) note on implementing natural language process tasks, especially sequence-to-sequence tasks. We mainly use [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq).

## Preparation: setup fairseq

```
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.git
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./
cd ../
```
